# Bootstrap Smokeping template

This is a template that's designed to replace the basepage.html file of your smokeping install. It should make the UI look less hideous.

This is laregely taken from the bootstrap "Dashboard" example, so there may be elements that're not required in the HTML. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

## Screenshot

This is what it looks like:
